# luca-gangjob

`luca-gangjob` is a gangjob resource for [FiveM](https://fivem.net/), and is entirely useless without a `cfx-server` running and a `FiveM` client connected to that server.
I made this resource as a base script, feel free to experiment with it, add your own things and adjust it to your likings.

## Assumptions

This documentation *assumes* you know the basics of editing `.lua` files. It is highly recommended to play around with this on your test server before actually using it in production.

It is also assumed that you are familiar with [the vector3 data type](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/scripting-reference/runtimes/lua/functions/vector3/).

## Support

Absolutely no support what so ever is given for this resource. If you have an issue with it you are invited to create an issue here on GitHub, but there are absolutely no guarantees that I will do anything about it. You can dm me on discord also if you want.
